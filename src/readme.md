# Object-oriented programming
An object-oriented programming is a way programming which enables programmers to think like they are working with real-life entities(a thing with distinct and independent existence) or objects. In real-life, people have knowledge and can do various works. In OOP, objects have fields to store knowledge/state/data and can do various works — methods.

## Basic Terminologies:
###Object:
It’s the instance of a class/ it’s the working entity of a class.
###Class:
It is a template or blue print about the capability of what an object can do.
###Method:
The behaviours of a class. It tells what a method can do.
###Instance:
Object and Instance both are same with small difference.
A blueprint for a house design is like a class description. All the houses built from that blueprint are objects of that class. A given house is an instance.
